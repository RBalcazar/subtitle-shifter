Subtitle Shifter does an easy bit of string manipulation and datetime math to shift your subtitles to match your film.

USAGE:
$ python shiftsubs.py <source_file> <write_file> <time_difference>

source_file:	The file to read from
write_file:	The file to write to
time_change:	The change in seconds to shift the subtitles, e.g. 2 or -5
